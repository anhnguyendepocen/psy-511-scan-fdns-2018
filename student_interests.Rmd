### Key terms and concepts

- I am fascinated with the construct of empathy. At a basic level, empathy is critical to interpersonal functioning. Thus, I am interested in how empathy occurs (e.g., social learning, neural processes) and the outcomes of a lack of empathy/apathy. 
- I am curious about the role mirror neurons play (or do not play) in the interpersonal experience of empathy.
- A relatively new concept to me is brain-to-brain coupling, which I understand as synchronization of two brains through environmental cues. However, this process of syncing still seems mystical to me.

### Key terms and concepts

- Neurotherapy (EEG biofeedback)-specifically how this process works and how can it be applied to treatment of post-concussion syndrome (other treatments more broadly)
- Metabolic cascade and the window of vulnerability caused by physiological changes following concussion
- The impact of head injury on the blood brain barrier (so the impact at the more micro level/neuronal level) and subsequent clinical implications of this. How can these changes at the neural level compare to clinically observed behavior?

### Key terms and concepts

- To what extent and how does the researcher hypotheses influence the decisions on were to draw the line in terms of what regions / voxels to analyze? Given the lack of consistency across researchers, it seems like voxel-hacking could occur, and it’s unclear to me what criteria are used to make these decisions about parsing voxels in a way that is not biased towards the research question.
- How can we evaluate “distinct neural correlates”? What criteria are used to determine ‘distinctness’, and what is a sufficient criteria to say that a neural correlate is distinct? Part of the debate here seems to be about how this information is interpreted. For example, Barrett and Wager argue the patterns are not distinct because they are more general to approach / withdraw systems; whereas Vital and Hamann argue that patterns are distinct because they differ from other emotional activation patterns in a statistically significant manner. Given that multiple functions are performed by any given area or network of the brain, it seems odd in the Barrett paper to make the argument that because the patterns of activation of certain emotions are also associated with approach and withdrawal that it renders these emotions as indistinct in terms of activation patterns.
- Both papers bring up the notion of consistency of activation, and draw opposite conclusions. I’m interested in learning more about how to evaluate consistency—what is considered a ’consistent’ pattern of activation? Are there specific thresholds that should be reached?
