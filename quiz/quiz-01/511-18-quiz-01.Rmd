# Describe the main components of the central nervous system associated with the lateral ventricles.

# What region of the brain is associated with the cerebral aqueduct?

# What parts of the brain are associated with the 4th ventricle?

# Label the planes of section illustrated in each of the three panels in the figure below:

# The arrow in the figure above points to a major sulcus on the lateral surface of the cerebral cortex, the [........], which divides the [........] from the parietal lobes.

# Primary [........] cortex is located on the \emph{anterior} bank of this sulcus in the [........] lobe.

# Primary [........] cortex is located on the \emph{posterior} bank of this sulcus in the [........] lobe.

# In each of the panels in the figure, label as many of the following directional terms as you are able to use: anterior/posterior; superior/inferior; medial/lateral; dorsal/ventral. 
# The [........] is a forebrain structure that controls ingestion, defense, and reproductive behavior. It is also the means by which the CNS controls both the [........] system via the pituitary gland and the [........] nervous system.

# The [........] is a forebrain structure located deep within the (medial/lateral) portions of the [........] lobe. It captures and stores behaviorally relevant information about specific places and locations.

# Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an example of a brain imaging technique with [........] temporal resolution. DTI provides information about [........].

# Functional MRI (fMRI) is considered an \emph{indirect} measure of neuronal activity because...

# Describe at least two ways that neurons differ from other cells in the body.

# (BONUS) [......] are the type of glial cell found in the PNS; [........] are found in the CNS.

# (BONUS) The arrows in the figure below point to the [........], a structure early anatomists thought looked like a seahorse.
